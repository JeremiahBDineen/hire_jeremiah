  <h1>Mean Income</h1>
  <section><p>In the following blog post we explore the distribution of mean income across US counties in 2023. This data is sourced from the American Community Survey S1901 tables which can be obtained via https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST5Y2023.S1901?q=income&g=010XX00US$0500000.</p></section>

  <section><img src="output/plots/mean_income_1.png" alt="Mean Income Plot 1" /></section>
  <section><p>This plot expresses the distribution of mean income per county across the US. It’s important to note we already explored median income which is not the same as mean income. These values may often associate closely, yet understanding why they might differ can be an elucidating venture. Note, the same color scale is being used between the median income plot and mean income plot to make simultaneous analysis more simple. This also makes evident the pattern that this map is much more blue/purple compared to the previous mostly red/orange map for the median. On a national level, we see a pattern that for most counties mean income is considerably and reliable higher than median income. This is an often occurrence in statistics as medians are less influenced by outliers. The statistical measure of the median corresponds to the 50th percentile where 50% of the values of the dataset are less than the median value and 50% of values are greater. If you start with the same dataset and drag the 90th percentile higher, this doesn’t change the value of the median at all so long as 50% of values are to the left and 50% to the right. This is not the case at all for the mean (or arithmetic average) which is simply the sum of all values divided by the count of values. If two counties with 50,000 people have a very similar income makeup yet one town has a private living community with about two dozen ultra wealthy individuals: the median income may be near identical while the mean may be several orders of magnitude higher.</p></section>

  <section><p>Similar to the mean income concentration, the concentration curve deviates only a small amount from a 45 degree line symbolizing a perfect egalitarian distribution. The top 10% of counties contribute to about 15% of the cumulative mean income. The top 50% of counties contribute to about 60% of cumulative mean income. A common topic in contemporary culture is the concentration of wealth and income in the nation, so the lack of concentration by this measure may seem a surprise to some. An important topic in statistics (especially in predictive modeling and pharmaceutical trials) is ANOVA (analysis of variance) specifically, decomposition of sum of squares. The statistical methodology can shine a light on why it can be true and false at the same time that wealth/income is concentrated. In the context of decomposition of sum of squares, statisticians talk about sum of squares between groups and sum of squares within groups. In this analysis of income across the groups of counties, we see income is not very highly concentrated (between different counties), however within many counties of the US very high levels of income concentration may be present. It may be helpful to explore income across counties, but it is not a principal factor in determining the distribution of income.</p></section>
  <section><img src="output/plots/mean_income_3.png" alt="Mean Income Plot 3" /></section>
  <section><p>As we did previously, we can split our original numeric variable into a factor variable with a few levels. To keep things simple and easy to compare, we can keep the same partition as we had for median income groups. This time above 100K comprises about 18% of observations. 75K to 100K is quite large with about half of the observations. About 30% of values are between 50K to 75K and less than 5% of counties have a mean income less than 50K.</p></section>
  <section><img src="output/plots/mean_income_4.png" alt="Mean Income Plot 4" /></section>
  <section><p>More than 3/4s of the counties are between 50K to 100K (orange and red). Extending our elevation metaphor from earlier we can conceptualize orange as valleys, red as sea level, purple areas as mountainous with blue being the highest peaks. From this plot we can clearly see the midwest has wealthy cities but even the ambient counties across the region remain about 75K to 100K, while areas outside cities in the Midatlantic quickly regress back to the 50K to 75K group. The Northeastern Corridor reliably exceeds 100K with many contiguous counties exceeding 125K. States along the west coast are almost always above 75K with Seattle, Portland and nearly the entire line of counties directly on the coast of California exceeding 125K. The high incomes in counties around Denver, Salt Lake City and Jackson appear even more prevalent on this map than the previous plots we saw on median income or population.</p></section>
  <section><img src="output/plots/mean_income_5.png" alt="Mean Income Plot 5" /></section>
  <section><p>Similar to the density plot of median income, we see an (approximate) normal distribution or bell curve shape. The median and mean of the distribution appear around the peak at 80K. Only 10% of counties have mean income below 63K. Only 10% counties have a mean greater than 112K. About half the counties have a mean that falls between 72K and 95K.</p></section>
  <section><img src="output/plots/mean_income_6.png" alt="Mean Income Plot 6" /></section>
  <section><p>The density plot (or empirical distribution) has the mean income color groupings to relate the distribution back to the previous spatial patterns we observed. In the median income distribution the 25th and 75th percentile both existed within the orange group, while for mean income (almost) both the percentiles exist within the bounds of the red group. It also seems the case that the mean income distribution has a longer right tail than the median income distribution which conveys there are a few counties that have a much higher mean income than the rest effectively dragging the mean rightward of the median.</p></section>
